# HotelBookingCancellationPrediction-Ensemble

This is a machine learning project for predicting hotel booking cancellations with ensemble learning. 

Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models to improve the predictive performance of a model. In this project, we used ensemble learning to predict the probability of hotel bookings being cancelled.
